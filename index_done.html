    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>There are all sorts of strands of creativity that contributed to what we now call electronic music. Even in the 19th century, Italian futurists
        were experimenting with electronically produced sounds. In the 1940's, magnetic audio tape became to be used (abused?) by modifying speed of recording of playback, reversing
        the tape, and cutting it together from <b>found sounds</b>. In the 1950's the first instances of algorithmically produced sounds - those generated by a computer program, first appeared.
    <blockquote>
        
            I was never worried that synthesizers would replace musicians. First of all, you have to be a musician in order to make music with a synthesizer.

    <h2>Types of Modern Electronic Music</h2>
    <p>Electronic music these days is created using a variety of techniques. One useful distinction is between <b>analog</b> and <b>digitally</b> produced music. 
        
        <dl>
            <dt>Analog Music</dt>
            <dd>Analog Music is created by by electronic components (detailed below), that modify, amplify, and filter electronic oscillations that produce the common basis of auditory information.</dd>
            <dt>Digital Music</dt>
            <dd>Digital Music is often created by microprocessors <i>simulating</i> the components of analog music production inside of a computer. These computers run software
            (a DAW) that is designed for the design, sequencing, and arranging of electronic music. </dd>

<h2>Components of Electronic Music Sound</h2>
<p>The following is a list of some of the components that make up electronic music:</p>
<ul>
    <dl>
        <dt>Oscillators</dt>
        <dd>Oscillators provide a variety of waveforms. Waveforms are patterns of electronic signal that can be made audible.</dd>

            <dt>Filters</dt>
            <dd>Filters remove portions of the waveform generated by an oscillator, changing the tone, or shape of the waveform.</dd>
       
            <dt>Voltage Controlled Amplifier (VCA)</dt>
            <dd>An amplifier for a signal that varies it's gain depending on a control source.</dd>
